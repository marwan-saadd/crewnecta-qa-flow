    Generate a personalized coaching plan for agent {agent_name} ({agent_id}).

    AGENT'S QA EVALUATIONS:
    {agent_evaluations}

    PATTERN INSIGHTS RELEVANT TO THIS AGENT:
    {agent_patterns}

    Create a coaching plan that:
    1. Assesses overall performance level: "exceeds", "meets", "below", or "critical"
    2. Identifies 2-3 key strengths with specific examples from their interactions
    3. Identifies 2-3 priority improvements with specific examples
       (e.g., "In interaction INT-003, when the customer said X, you responded with Y.
       Instead, try Z")
    4. Suggests concrete training actions (not generic advice like "be more empathetic")
    5. Sets a follow-up timeline based on severity:
       - Critical compliance issues: "48 hours — immediate remediation"
       - Below expectations: "1 week — focused coaching"
       - Meets with improvements: "2 weeks — check-in"
       - Exceeds: "1 month — recognition and stretch goals"
