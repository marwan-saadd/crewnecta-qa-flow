risk_scoring_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the following customer interaction transcript and assign a risk score.

    Interaction ID: {interaction_id}
    Channel: {channel}
    Agent: {agent_name} ({agent_id})

    TRANSCRIPT:
    {transcript_text}

    Use the Keyword Red Flag Scanner tool with the transcript text and channel type
    to identify red flags. Then combine the tool's output with your own assessment
    of the transcript to produce a final risk score.

    Consider these factors beyond keyword matching:
    - Overall customer sentiment and tone
    - Whether the issue was resolved
    - Length and complexity of the interaction
    - Any signs of agent confusion or uncertainty
